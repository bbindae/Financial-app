# TODO

_Created: 2026-02-11_

The following items are planned future work for the project. If you like, I can add priorities, break items down into detailed tasks, or implement any of them directly.

- [ ] Add "Day of Bible Verse" below the Element Screenshot (show Korean label first, then English)
- [x] Remove symbol duplicate check when entering transactions or importing files
- [x] Set default transaction sort order to Date Acquired (descending)
- [x] Add sort arrows (▲/▼) to each transaction column header
- [x] Add Total Quantity to the Total Summary
- [x] Add year/month filters to the Transaction history
- [ ] Add login (authentication) functionality
- [ ] Replace LocalStorage with Firebase for data persistence
- [ ] Add a realtime stock tracker and allows to add symbol tracked


Additional suggestion:
- Assign an estimated effort (e.g., 1–3h) and a priority (High/Medium/Low) to each item to help plan
